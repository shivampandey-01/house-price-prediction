# house-price-prediction

Task

1) Import and load the dataset from a specified source location.
2) Clean and preprocess the data to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and transform the dataset for analysis.
3)Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into house price trends and distributions.
4)Implement machine learning models to predict house prices based on property attributes.
5)Evaluate and compare the performance of different regression algorithms to identify the best-performing model for house price prediction.



conclusion

In conclusion, the analysis presented in this project sheds light on various aspects of house price trends and prediction using machine learning. Through thorough data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning modeling, we have gained valuable insights into the dataset's structure and patterns. The findings from statistical overviews and visualizations have highlighted key trends in property types, city-wise distributions, and average prices across different localities. Moreover, the evaluation of multiple regression models has provided a comparative analysis of their performance in predicting house prices. Moving forward, the results can be utilized to inform real estate decisions, pricing strategies, and market insights based on a comprehensive understanding of the dataset.
